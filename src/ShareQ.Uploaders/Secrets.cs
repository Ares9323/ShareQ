/// <summary>Bundled OAuth client credentials for the built-in uploaders. This file ships with
/// every constant set to the empty string — fresh clones / CI builds compile cleanly but no
/// uploader will sign-in until the user supplies their own credentials in the Settings dialog.
///
/// Maintainers ship a real build by creating <c>Secrets.Local.cs</c> alongside this file with
/// the same class and the same constants but real values. The <c>.csproj</c> uses a
/// <c>&lt;Compile Remove="Secrets.cs" Condition="Exists('Secrets.Local.cs')" /&gt;</c> so the
/// Local copy wins when present and end-users get zero-friction sign-in. <c>Secrets.Local.cs</c>
/// is gitignored — the real keys never enter the public repo.
///
/// Why <c>internal</c>: the constants are only consumed by uploaders inside this assembly. If
/// they leaked to a downstream package they'd embed our keys into anyone's redistribution.</summary>
