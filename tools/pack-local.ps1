# Local Velopack packaging dry-run — mirrors what .github/workflows/release.yml does in CI,
# minus the "upload to GitHub" final step. Produces the same artifacts (Setup.exe + Portable.zip
# + .nupkg + RELEASES) under Releases/ so you can install/run them locally before cutting a real
# tag.
#
# Usage (from the repo root):
#   pwsh tools/pack-local.ps1                     # auto-pick last version, overwrite
#   pwsh tools/pack-local.ps1 -Version 0.2.0      # explicit version
#   pwsh tools/pack-local.ps1 -SkipBuild          # reuse previous bin/Release output
#   pwsh tools/pack-local.ps1 -KeepReleases       # don't wipe existing artifacts (preserves delta baseline)
#
# After it finishes:
#   - Releases\ShareQ-<channel>-Setup.exe       → run to install into %LocalAppData%\ShareQ
#   - Releases\ShareQ-<channel>-Portable.zip    → unzip anywhere and run ShareQ.exe directly
#   - Releases\ShareQ-<ver>-full.nupkg          → Velopack catalog file (the in-app updater fetches it)
#
# The script exits on the first failed step so a broken publish doesn't leave you with a stale
# Releases\ that still references the previous good build.
